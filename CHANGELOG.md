## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffolding: git repository, `.gitattributes` (`* -text`, no line-ending
  conversion), `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `_git_hooks/pre-commit` + `install-git-hooks.ps1` (changelog guard).
- `Jellyfin.Plugin.JFLint`: plugin project targeting `net9.0` (Jellyfin 10.11.11) and
  `net10.0` (Jellyfin 12.0.0-rc3) from one source tree. The v12 build compiles but is
  **untested** - no v12 server available yet.
- `GET /JFLint/EpisodesWithoutSeason`: episodes whose season could not be determined
  (`ParentIndexNumber IS NULL`), resolved through `ILibraryManager`. Uses only public,
  promised interfaces.
- `GET /JFLint/EpisodesWithoutSeasonDB`: the same question answered straight from
  `JellyfinDbContext`, so the filter runs as SQL and only matching rows leave the
  database. The episode type string comes from `IItemTypeLookup` rather than being
  hardcoded. Both routes require `RequiresElevation`, because the response contains
  file paths.
- `jellyfin.ruleset` taken verbatim from `jellyfin-plugin-template`, so the build
  matches Jellyfin's house style while `TreatWarningsAsErrors` stays on.
